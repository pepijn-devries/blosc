[Blosc](https://www.blosc.org/) is a blocking, shuffling and lossless
compression algorithm. It is often used to compress n-dimensional
structured array data. It is applied (amongst others) in the geo-spatial
[zarr](https://zarr.dev/) file format. This package ports BLOSC
compressors and decompressors to R.

## Installation

Install latest developmental version from R-Universe:

``` r
install.packages("blosc", repos = c('https://pepijn-devries.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

MacOS users may first need to install system requirements before
installing the package using:

``` r
source("https://mac.R-project.org/bin/install.R")
install.libs("blosc")
```

## Example

The blosc package can be uesd to compress `raw` data, but also vectors
of other data types. The example below shows how data from the volcano
matrix can be compressed with blosc.

``` r
library(blosc)

volcano_compressed <-
  blosc_compress(volcano, typesize = 2L, dtype = "<f2")

object.size(volcano_compressed)
#> 6312 bytes
object.size(volcano)
#> 42672 bytes
```

Note that 16 bit floating (`<f2`) point numbers are used for the
compression which are much less precise than Râ€™s native 64 bit floating
point numbers. Nonetheless, in this particular case the precision is
sufficient to restore the volcano data.

``` r
volcano_reconstructed <-
  matrix(
    blosc_decompress(volcano_compressed, dtype = "<f2"),
    nrow(volcano),
    ncol(volcano)
  )

image(volcano_reconstructed, col = terrain.colors(24L))
```
