*Status: experimental*. A package that ports BLOSC compressors and
decompressors to R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of blosc from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("pepijn-devries/blosc")
```

MacOS users may first need to install system requirements before
installing the package using:

``` r
source("https://mac.R-project.org/bin/install.R")
install.libs("blosc")
```

## Example

The blosc package can be uesd to compress `raw` data, but also vectors
of other data types. The example below shows how data from the volcano
matrix can be compressed with blosc.

``` r
library(blosc)

volcano_compressed <-
  blosc_compress(volcano, typesize = 2L, dtype = "<f2")

object.size(volcano_compressed)
#> 6312 bytes
object.size(volcano)
#> 42672 bytes
```

Note that 16 bit floating (`<f2`) point numbers are used for the
compression which are much less precise than Râ€™s native 64 bit floating
point numbers. Nonetheless, in this particular case the precision is
sufficient to restore the volcano data.

``` r
volcano_reconstructed <-
  matrix(
    blosc_decompress(volcano_compressed, dtype = "<f2"),
    nrow(volcano),
    ncol(volcano)
  )

image(volcano_reconstructed, col = terrain.colors(24L))
```
