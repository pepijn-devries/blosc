[Blosc](https://www.blosc.org/) is a blocking, shuffling and lossless compression
algorithm. It is often used to compress n-dimensional structured
array data. It is applied (amongst others) in the geo-spatial
[zarr](https://zarr.dev/) file format. This package ports BLOSC compressors and
decompressors to R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of blosc from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("pepijn-devries/blosc")
```

MacOS users may first need to install system requirements before installing the package using:

```r
source("https://mac.R-project.org/bin/install.R")
install.libs("blosc")
```

## Example

The blosc package can be uesd to compress `raw` data, but also vectors of
other data types. The example below shows how data from the volcano matrix
can be compressed with blosc.

```{r example1}
library(blosc)

volcano_compressed <-
  blosc_compress(volcano, typesize = 2L, dtype = "<f2")

object.size(volcano_compressed)
object.size(volcano)
```

Note that 16 bit floating (`<f2`) point numbers are used for the compression which
are much less precise than R's native 64 bit floating point numbers.
Nonetheless, in this particular case the precision is sufficient to restore
the volcano data.

```{r example2}
volcano_reconstructed <-
  matrix(
    blosc_decompress(volcano_compressed, dtype = "<f2"),
    nrow(volcano),
    ncol(volcano)
  )

image(volcano_reconstructed, col = terrain.colors(24L))
```
